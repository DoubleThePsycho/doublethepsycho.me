#### Disclaimer:
I am a hobby-developer, I learn and work as I go, I do this for fun.
Any code used in my projects may be:
- Unnesecarily complicated.
- Dumb. Just dumb.
- Very hacky ways of doing it.
- Copy/paste from github and stackoverflow.
- Written while I was stoned out of my mind. (This one was helpful lol)
- All of the above.

I know my code might be hacky as shit, but it works for what I want to use it for.
Plus I'm a forgetful cunt so if I have the code somewhere I can copy it for later lol.
I remember looking for premade sites and not finding shit that did what I wanted, and was simple enough for me to understand and modify the code.
I offer the code for my websites for anyone else who are still getting into it and wants something basic but customizeable.
Everyone is free to use my code for free, although credits is highly appreciated :)
For my own projects, I like to do shit "my way", but if you have feedback on how to do things differently or more efficiently, feedback is always welcome.

Happy copy/pasting ^^
